SCORING
• IMPORTANT: The BKB-SIN Test contains 18 List Pairs that are equated for difficulty.
Each List Pair has two lists; both lists of the pair (A&B) must be administered for valid
scoring. Each List Pair takes approximately three minutes to administer and score.
• The first sentence in each list has four key words, and the remaining sentences each
have three. Give one point for each key word repeated correctly (key words are underlined on the score sheets). Write the number of correct words for each sentence on the
line provided.
• Add the number of correct words for each list, putting the sum in the space provided.
Subtract total correct from 23.5 to obtain SNR-50 (signal-to-noise ratio for 50% correct).
SNR-50 = 23.5 - Total Correct
• Score each list, then average the two scores for the List Pair using the space
provided on the score sheets (see Figure 1 on page 2). When administering more than
one List Pair, average the SNR-50 scores across List Pairs. As in any measure, reliability
is influenced by the number of items presented. See Table 4 on page 14 of the BKB-SIN
Test manual to determine the desired number of List Pairs.
• Calculate SNR Loss by subtracting the SNR-50 score from the group-average value.
SNR Loss = Subject's SNR-50 - Average SNR-50 for that Subject Category

Scoring Example

10.5 + 7.5 =18
18 : 2 = 9

Note: An interesting phenomenon occurs in five sentences when the Standard and Split
Track recordings are compared: normal-hearing listeners perceive a different word on the
Standard recording than on the Split Track recordings. For example, when the target talker
and background babble are presented from a single source using the Standard recording
(earphone or loudspeaker presentation), sentence nine of List 2B is heard as “The boy has
black tie.” When the target talker and background babble are spatially separated using
the Split Track recordings (target talker from one loudspeaker and background babble
from another loudspeaker), sentence nine of List 2B is heard as “The boy has black hair.”
In the first instance, the word “tie” (spoken by one of the babble talkers) masks the word
“hair” (spoken by the target talker). For this reason, two possible correct answers are
shown on the score sheet (see Figure 1 on page 3). Sentences containing a key word
with two possible correct answers are: List 2B, sentence 9; List 8A, sentence 5; List 8B,
sentence 9; List 15B, sentence 5; and List 18A, sentence 7.

Privacy Policy for NU-6 Phoneme Scorer

Last Updated: 12/25/25

1. Introduction

The NU-6 Phoneme Scorer ("the Software") is a desktop application designed for audiologists and clinicians to score and track speech recognition tests. This Privacy Policy describes how data is handled within the application.

2. Data Collection and Storage

The Software operates on a "Local-First" basis.

No Cloud Storage: The Software does not connect to any external cloud database (such as Firebase, AWS, or Google Cloud) for storing patient records.

Local Storage: All patient data, including Names, Patient IDs, and Test Results, are stored strictly on the local hard drive of the computer running the Software, using the browser's IndexedDB technology.

No Data Transmission: The Software does not transmit patient data to the developer, GitHub, or any third party.

3. HIPAA Compliance

Because the Software functions offline and stores data locally:

It allows clinicians to maintain HIPAA compliance by keeping PHI (Protected Health Information) contained within their secure internal network or device.

User Responsibility: The security of the patient data depends entirely on the physical and digital security of the computer where the Software is installed. Users are responsible for encrypting their hard drives and using strong passwords to protect the local database.

4. Analytics

The Software does not contain tracking pixels, analytics scripts, or telemetry that reports usage back to the developer.
